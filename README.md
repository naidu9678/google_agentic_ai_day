‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment to Google Cloud
This project is designed to be deployed with a serverless architecture using Google Cloud Run for the backend and Firebase Hosting for the frontend.

1. Backend Deployment to Cloud Run
The backend is deployed as a containerized service using Cloud Buildpacks, which automatically detect the Python environment and dependencies.

Important: Before deploying, make sure your Procfile in the backend directory is correctly configured:

text
web: gunicorn -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker -b 0.0.0.0:$PORT main:app
Navigate to the backend directory and run the following command:

bash
gcloud run deploy financial-advisor-ai-backend \
  --source . \
  --region "us-central1" \
  --memory "2Gi" \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --project "your-gcp-project-id"
--source .: Deploys the code from the current directory.

--region: Specify your preferred Google Cloud region.

--memory "2Gi": Allocates 2 GiB of memory. This is often necessary for AI/ML libraries.

--allow-unauthenticated: Makes the service publicly accessible. Remove this flag for private services.

Once deployed, gcloud will provide you with a Service URL. You will need this for the frontend configuration.

2. Frontend Deployment to Firebase
The React app needs to know the URL of your deployed Cloud Run backend.

a. Configure the Backend URL:

In your frontend/src directory, locate the file where the API endpoint is defined (e.g., api.js or App.js) and update it with your Cloud Run Service URL.

b. Build the React App:

bash
# In the /frontend directory
npm run build
This creates an optimized, static build of your application in the build directory.

c. Deploy to Firebase Hosting:

If you haven't already, initialize Firebase in your project:

bash
# Run this from the /frontend directory
firebase init hosting
Follow the prompts:

Select your Firebase project.

Set your public directory to build.

Configure as a single-page app (SPA): Yes.

Set up automatic builds and deploys with GitHub: No (for now).

Now, deploy the application:

bash
firebase deploy --only hosting
Firebase will provide you with a Hosting URL. This is the public URL for your chatbot.

You have now successfully deployed the AI-powered financial advisor

‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Deployment
Step 1: Deploy the Backend to Cloud Run
The gcloud run deploy command uses Google's built-in Buildpacks to containerize and deploy the application from your source code.

Navigate to the backend directory.

Run the deployment command:

bash
gcloud run deploy financial-advisor-ai-backend \
  --source . \
  --region "us-central1" \
  --memory "2Gi" \
  --timeout "600s" \
  --allow-unauthenticated
--memory "2Gi": Allocates 2 GiB of memory. AI/ML libraries can be memory-intensive.

--timeout "600s": Sets a 10-minute timeout for requests, useful for long-running agent tasks.

--allow-unauthenticated: Makes the endpoint public. For production, you should implement IAM-based authentication.

After the deployment succeeds, copy the Service URL provided in the output. It will look like: https://financial-advisor-ai-backend-xxxxxxxxxx-uc.a.run.app

Step 2: Configure and Deploy the Frontend to Firebase
Update the API Endpoint:

In the frontend source code, find the configuration file where the backend URL is set (e.g., src/config.js or directly in a component).

Replace the local URL (http://localhost:8000) with the Cloud Run Service URL you copied in the previous step.

Initialize Firebase (if you haven't already):

bash
# Run from the /frontend directory
firebase init hosting
Select Use an existing project and choose your GCP project.

What do you want to use as your public directory? build

Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? Yes

Set up automatic builds and deploys with GitHub? No

Build and Deploy the Frontend:

bash
# Run from the /frontend directory
npm run build
firebase deploy --only hosting
Once complete, Firebase will provide the Hosting URL. This is the public link to your production-ready chatbot!
